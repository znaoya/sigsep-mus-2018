## Method

This submission uses a bi-directional LSTM network as described in [1] with
three BLSTM layers, each having 500 cells. For each instrument, a network is
trained which predicts the target instrument amplitude from the mixture
amplitude in the STFT domain (frame size: 4096, hop size: 1024). The raw
output of each network is then combined by a multichannel Wiener filter as
described in [2] where we estimate the power spectral densities and spatial
covariance matrices from the DNN outputs.

The network is trained on `musdb` where we split `train` into `train_train`
and `train_valid` with 86 and 14 songs, respectively. The validation set is
used to perform early stopping and hyperparameter selection (LSTM layer dropout
rate, regularization strength).
