## Method

Denoising auto-encoder with skip connections. It shares some similarities with the U-Net proposed by Jansson et al. [2], but has some major differences in architecture design and skip connections. Further information will be updated in [1].

In comparison to JY1 model, this one adds an enhancement module in addition to the main separation module.
