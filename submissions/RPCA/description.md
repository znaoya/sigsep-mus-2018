## Method

The ``nussl`` implementation of RPCA for audio source separation.

Abstract from the original paper:

    Separating singing voices from music accompaniment is
    an important task in many applications, such as music infor-
    mation retrieval, lyric recognition and alignment. Music ac-
    companiment can be assumed to be in a low-rank subspace,
    because of its repetition structure; on the other hand, singing
    voices can be regarded as relatively sparse within songs. In
    this paper, based on this assumption, we propose using ro-
    bust principal component analysis for singing-voice separa-
    tion from music accompaniment. Moreover, we examine the
    separation result by using a binary time-frequency masking
    method. Evaluations on the MIR-1K dataset show that this
    method can achieve around 1âˆ¼1.4 dB higher GNSDR com-
    pared with two state-of-the-art approaches without using prior
    training or requiring particular features.
